        <h2>Linear Data Structure</h2>
        <ul class="list" style="font-size: 25px;">
            <li>The elements of such a structure are arranged sequentially.</li>
            <li>Every element can be accessed by traversing through the linear structure.</li>
            <li>All the elements of a linear structure are at a single level, i.e there is no hierarchy.</li>
            <li>They are easy to implement and use.</li>
            <li>They utilize more memory, hence they are not very memory-friendly.</li>
            <li>The time complexity of linear data structure usually increases when the size of the structure increases.</li>
            <li>Examples include: array,linked-list,stack,queue</li>

        <h4 class="linear2">Array</h4>
        <h4 class="linear2">Linked-list</h4>
        <div class="list" id="ll">
            A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.
            Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.

        <h4 class="linear2">Stack</h4>
        <div class="list" id="stack">
            stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages. It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example â€“ a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc.

        <h4 class="linear2">Queue</h4>
        <div class="list" id="queue">
            Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.
