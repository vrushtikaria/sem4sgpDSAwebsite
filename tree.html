            <li>A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.</li>

            <h3>Why Tree Data Structure?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that store data sequentially. In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size. But, it is not acceptable in today's computational world.</li><br>
                <li>Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <h3>Tree Terminologies</h3>
            <ul>
                <h3>Node</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.</li><br>
                    <li>The last nodes of each path are called leaf nodes or external nodes that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes.</li><br>
                    <li>The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.</li><br>
                </ul>
                <h3>Edge</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is the link between any two nodes.</li>
                    <img src="https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/nodes-edges_0.png" alt="" height="200" width="220">
                </ul>
                <h3>Height of a Node</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the node to a leaf node).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Depth of a Node</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Height of a Tree</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.</li>
                    <img src="https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/height-depth_1.png" alt="" height="200" width="220">
                </ul>
                <h3>Degree of a Node</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Types of Tree</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Binary Tree</li>
                    <li>Binary Search Tree</li>
                    <li>AVL Tree</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Tree Traversal</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In order to perform any operation on a tree, you need to reach to the specific node. The tree traversal algorithm helps in visiting a required node in the tree.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tree Applications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Binary Search Trees(BSTs) are used to quickly check whether an element is present in a set or not.</li>
                    <li>Heap is a kind of tree that is used for heap sort.</li>
                    <li>A modified version of a tree called Tries is used in modern routers to store routing information.</li>
                    <li>Most popular databases use B-Trees and T-Trees, which are variants of the tree structure we learned above to store their data</li>
                    <li>Compilers use a syntax tree to validate the syntax of every program you write.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
